# W/kg {{< fa bolt >}}

You may -- or may not, it may be pretty niche -- be familiar with the W/kg calculations of pro cyclists' climbing performances floating around on the internet. These blog posts are my attempt to explore the models behind these estimates and to provide some interactive tools so you can do the same. If you're interested, also be sure to check out some of the work by the team behind [Lantern Rouge Media](https://lanternerouge.com), by [Frédéric Portoleau](https://www.chronoswatts.com/de), by [ammattipyöräily](https://bsky.app/profile/ammattipyoraily.bsky.social), and by [belhill1985](https://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/155tq0a/power_estimation_for_the_stage_16_itt/).
