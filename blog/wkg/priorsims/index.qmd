## What’s the Deal with Uncertainty?
When estimating a pro cyclist's watts per kilogram (W/kg), we have to make a bunch of assumptions --- things like drag coefficient, frontal area, rider weight, air density, and so on. Since we don't know the exact values, our assumptions carry some uncertainty. But W/kg estimates are often reported as single point values, giving us little sense of how confident we can actually be in them. (Some exceptions exist---e.g., some estimates by [Frédéric Portoleau](https://www.chronoswatts.com/) and [ammattipyöräily](https://bsky.app/profile/ammattipyoraily.bsky.social).)

In this first blog post, I want to explore how uncertainty in our assumptions affects the final estimate --- or really, I\'m just giving you some interactive tools to do that yourself. To be clear --- this isn't anything fancy. Instead of plugging in fixed values, we just assign each parameter a range that reflects our uncertainty. We then sample from those ranges and calculate the W/kg for each set of values. That gives us a distribution of plausible outputs, showing what range of power estimates is consistent with our assumptions. (I only recently came across Portoleau's site --- it looks like he might be doing something similar, though I'm not totally sure.)

## A Simplified (Not-So-Realistic) Model

To keep things simple, I'm using a stripped-down version of the model from [Martin et al. 1998](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279937184_Validation_of_a_Mathematical_Model_for_Road_Cycling_Power). If you want a more accessible explanation, check out [Steve Gribble's power-speed-calculator](https://www.gribble.org/cycling/power_v_speed.html) and this [article by Antoine Vayer](https://www.cyclisme-dopage.com/puissances/2013-07-19-lemonde-fr.htm). In this model, the power produced by a cyclist is given by the power needed to overcome aerodynamic drag ($P_{AD}$), rolling resistance ($P_{RR}$), and gravity ($P_G$).

$$
P = P_{AD} + P_{RR} + P_{G}
$$

$$
P_{AD} = \frac{1}{2} *\rho *CdA * v^3
$$

$$
P_{RR} = Crr *m *g * cos(\theta) * v
$$

$$
P_{G} = m*g*v*sin(\theta) * v
$$

## Fixed Gradients, Fixed Speeds

In the first section below, you can set a range for each parameter. The app will then randomly draw values from those ranges --- for example, if you set CdA to go from 0.2 to 0.3, it\'ll sample evenly from anywhere in that range, averaging around 0.25. The plot will show the range in which 90% of the calculated values land, given your assumptions.

## Fully Custom Inputs

This second section works a bit differently. Instead of fixed values for speed and gradient, you can now enter your own data in the Data tab. For all other parameters, you set a central value and a spread. That spread defines a uniform range. So if Rider A has a CdA of 0.25 ± 0.05, values will be sampled between 0.20 and 0.30. If Rider B\'s central CdA is 0.30 with the same spread, their values go from 0.25 to 0.35. Again, the plot shows where 90% of the sampled W/kg values fall based on these inputs.
