In this first blog post, I want to explore how uncertainty in our assumptions affects uncertainty in the estimated W/kg. When estimating pro cyclists\' W/kg, we have to make assumptions about parameters like CdA, rider weight, air density, and so on. Since we don\'t know their true values, these assumptions come with uncertainty. Yet W/kg estimates are typically reported as single point values, offering no indication of how confident we can be in them. (Some exceptions exist---e.g., some estimates by [Frédéric Portoleau](https://www.chronoswatts.com/) and [ammattipyöräily](https://bsky.app/profile/ammattipyoraily.bsky.social).)

Instead of assigning each parameter a fixed value, we give it a distribution that reflects our uncertainty, then sample from these and calculate W/kg for each draw. This yields a distribution of plausible power outputs---helping us understand the range of outcomes consistent with our assumptions. (I only recently came across Frédéric Portoleau\'s site. He may have done something similar, though I\'m not entirely sure.)

## A simplified model

To keep things straightforward, I adopted a simplified version of the model proposed in [Martin et al. 1998](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279937184_Validation_of_a_Mathematical_Model_for_Road_Cycling_Power). (Approachable explanations of this model can be found on [Steve Gribble's power-speed-calculator](https://www.gribble.org/cycling/power_v_speed.html) and in this [article by Antoine Vayer](https://www.cyclisme-dopage.com/puissances/2013-07-19-lemonde-fr.htm).) In this model, the power produce by a cyclist is given by the power needed to overcome aerodynamic drag ($P_{AD}$), rolling resistance ($P_{RR}$), and gravity ($P_G$).

$$
P = P_{AD} + P_{RR} + P_{G}
$$

$$
P_{AD} = \frac{1}{2} *\rho *CdA * v^3
$$

$$
P_{RR} = Crr *m *g * cos(\theta) * v
$$

$$
P_{G} = m*g*v*sin(\theta) * v
$$

## Select gradients and speeds

Below, you can enter a range for each parameter. The app will then sample values uniformly from within that range. For example, if you set CdA to range from 0.2 to 0.3, values will be drawn equally from anywhere between 0.2 and 0.3---so on average, they\'ll center around 0.25. The plot shows the range in which 90% of the calculated values fall, given these assumptions.

## Custom gradients and speeds

This app is somewhat similar to the one above. But instead of fixed values for speed and gradient, you can now enter your own in the Data tab. For the other parameters, you\'ll set a central value and use a slider to define the spread around it. This spread determines the lower and upper limits of a uniform distribution. For example, if Rider A has a central CdA of 0.25 and a spread of ±0.05, values will be sampled between 0.20 and 0.30. If Rider B\'s central CdA is 0.30 with the same spread, their values will range from 0.25 to 0.35. Again, the plot shows the range in which 90% of the sampled values fall, given the assumptions.
